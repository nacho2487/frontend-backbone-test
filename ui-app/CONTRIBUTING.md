## How to contribute to First frontend app

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mercadolibre/First frontend app/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mercadolibre/First frontend app/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Do you want to patch a bug or want to add a feature?**

* Make sure there's an issue for what you want to add.
    - If there isn't an issue, open one and assign it to the maintainer.
* Clone the project and branch out of develop.
* Follow this naming convention:
    - For a fix, the branch name should start with `fix/`
    - For a feature (be it new or a feature of a feature), the branch name should start with `feature/`
    - After the category, the name should be at most three words long, all in lowercase and hyphen-separated.
    - Example: `feature/debounce`, `fix/question-box-height`
* Work on your branch normally.
* Each commit should be significant on its own and should reference the issue number.
* Once finished, open a new GitHub pull request with the fix or feature.
    - The title should be `Resolves #issue-id - Meaningful short title`
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number.

Thank you!
